Notes:
- In LocalStorage, game properties I need:
    -game.gameOver, game.turn, game.p1/p2.winner
    -other: game.gameId, game.p1/p2.id
- Properties in Game db that need persisted
    - turn, game_over, winner_id


current:
-inside function handlePoll(httpRequest) , need board to redraw after every poll
-this is based on the def poll(): and what it returns. does it return whats in the db or whats in local LocalStorage   
    -what are we restoring from, db or local storage
