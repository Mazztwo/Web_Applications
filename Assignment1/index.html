        <p>
            I am <span id="my-name">Alessio</span>! I'm a Senior studying Computer Science 
            at the University of Pittsburgh. This is my <span class="degree-num">second</span> Bachelor's
            degree from Pitt. I got my <span class="degree-num">first</span> degree in 2015 and decided to
            come back to finish up a <span class="degree-num">second</span> after feeling that my <span class="degree-num">first</span>
            degree left me wholly unprepared for the <span class="harsh">brutal</span> job market.
        </p>

        <p>
            I moved to the <span class="usa">United States</span> from Bari, <span class="italia">Italy</span> in 2001. 
            I have been living in the <span class="usa">States</span> since. 
            My hobbies include:
            <ul id="hobbies">
                <li>long strolls</li>
                <li>reading</li>
                <li>playing video games with great stories</li>
                <li>watching movies</li>
                <li>writing</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="finisher">
            I look forward to learning about building web applications, as it is my desire to work
            as a web developer after I graduate!
